# portfolio-theory
Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. This project uses Python to make a progarm of MPT. Given prices of assets in past time, it outputs the weights of different assets we should assemble.
